<h1 class="title">Mürren</h1>
<h3 class="title">Bern Region</h3>
<p class='para' style="font-family:Verdana">Mürren – a former settlement of people from the Lötschen valley in the Valais, <br> which still remains recognisable today from the design of the houses and the pronunciation<br> of the Mürren dialect – is the highest, continually inhabited village settlement in the canton of <br> Bern and lies on a terrace at 1650 metres,  high above the Lauterbrunnen valley. <br> A double-cable ropeway leads up onto the plateau from Lauterbrunnen,<br> while a cableway runs from Stechelberg, past turbulent waterfalls and craggy rock faces, <br> into the centre of the car-free village of Mürren, and further to the Schilthorn at 2970 metres.</p>
<p class="para" style="font-family:Verdana">At the end of the 1960s, the makers of the Bond film “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service”<br> were immediately taken by the futuristic revolving restaurant on the Schilthorn: the<br> scenes involving the imaginary ‘Piz Gloria’ had to be shot here… The film became a<br> great success, the Schilthorn cableway and the revolving restaurant equally so. The<br> magnificent 360° panorama from the summit takes in the world-renowned Alpine<br> triumvirate of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau, reaching right to Mont Blanc and into the<br> Black Forest.
